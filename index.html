            (referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada), alternatively known as gridiron football,
            is a team sport, in which two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end 
            play against each other.</p>

        <h2>Offense and defense</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The offensive team is the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down 
            the field by running with the ball or passing it</li>
            <li>The defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance 
            and to take control of the ball for themselves</li>
            <li> A safety is a scoring play that results in a team getting 2 points on the scoreboard. It can occur if the offense 
            records a penalty in their own end zone, a ball carrier gets tackled in their own end zone after having the ball 
            outside of the end zone at any point during the play, or a fumble or other loose ball gets knocked out of the 
            back of the possessing team's end zone, or out of bounds in the end zone.
            </li>
            <li>Also known as a point-after-touchdown (PAT), it is a scoring opportunity in American football that takes 
            place immediately after a touchdown. The extra point allows a team to earn an additional point, bringing
            the total score for the scoring play to 7 points
            </li>
            <li>In a two-point conversion attempt, the team that just scored must run a play from scrimmage 
            close to the opponent's goal line and advance the ball across the goal line in the same manner 
            as if they were scoring a touchdown. If the team succeeds, it earns two additional points on top
            of the six points for the touchdown, for a total of eight points
            </li>
            <li>A touchdown is a scoring play in gridiron football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, 
            or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone.
            </li>
            <li>A kickoff is a method of starting a drive in gridiron football. Typically, a kickoff consists of one team - the 
            kicking team - kicking the ball to the opposing team - the receiving team
            </li>
            <li>Onside Kick: An onside kick is a strategic move used in American football during a kickoff. The objective is 
                for the kicking team to regain possession of the ball instead of kicking it far downfield to the receiving team.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Advance</h3>
       <p>The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays</p>
       <ul>
            <li>if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense</li> 
            <li>but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs 
            to continue the drive.</li> 
            <li>Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown 
            or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.</li>
            <li>Longest Field Goal in College Football: The longest field goal made in college football history was 
            69 yards long. The kick was made by Abilene Christian University's kicker, Ove Johansson, on October 16, 1976.
            </li>
            <li>Longest Field Goal in NFL: The longest field goal in NFL history is 66 yards, made by Justin Tucker of 
            the Baltimore Ravens.
            </li>
            <li>American football is a hodgepodge that developed from two sports: rugby and soccer.</li>
            <li>College and professional games last 60 minutes, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.
            The plays have frequent stops, so a game might last 2.5-3 hours or more.
            </li>
            <li>The first game of football was played between Rutgers and Princeton colleges on November 6, 1869.
            </li>

        </ul>  
        <p>The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.</p>
