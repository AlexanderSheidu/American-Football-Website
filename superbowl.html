        <h1>Super Bowl History</h1>
        <p>The Super Bowl is rich in history as it is the annual American football game 
            that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game
            culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the 
            conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The first Super Bowl was held on January 15, 1967. 
            Since then, it has become a significant event in American sports and culture, with 
            traditions such as elaborate halftime shows, commercials, and parties.
